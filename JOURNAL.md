This is my journal of the design and building process of **Wand**.

## 10/4/2025 - Chose the Microcontroller Used For the Project  

For this project, I decided to use the Raspberry Pi 2W because:
 - The RP2350 Chip has double the RAM compared to the old RP2040 chip, meaning it could run high 		  		 spec ML models
 - They are cheap, and I have one available to use
 - It supports wireless connectivity, which will be crucial for the wand to be able to communicate with other devices
 **Later on I might change form a full pico to a costume made PCB with a RP2350 chip**
